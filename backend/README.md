# todo-app-backend
It's a backend side for the todo-app. It's implemented with serverless + AWS Lambdas.


## Usage

### Deployment

Install dependencies with:

```
npm install
```

and then deploy with:

```
serverless deploy
```

After running deploy, you should see output similar to:

```
Deploying "aws-node-express-api" to stage "dev" (us-east-1)

âœ” Service deployed to stack aws-node-express-api-dev (96s)

endpoint: ANY - https://xxxxxxxxxx.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
functions:
  api: aws-node-express-api-dev-api (2.3 kB)
```

_Note_: In current form, after deployment, your API is public and can be invoked by anyone. For production deployments, you might want to configure an authorizer. For details on how to do that, refer to [`httpApi` event docs](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/events/http-api/).

### Invocation

After successful deployment, you can call the created application via HTTP:

```
curl https://xxxxxxx.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/
```

Which should result in the following response:

```json
{ "message": "Hello from root!" }
```

### Local development

The easiest way to develop and test your function is to use the `dev` command:

```
serverless dev
```

This will start a local emulator of AWS Lambda and tunnel your requests to and from AWS Lambda, allowing you to interact with your function as if it were running in the cloud.

Now you can invoke the function as before, but this time the function will be executed locally. Now you can develop your function locally, invoke it, and see the results immediately without having to re-deploy.

When you are done developing, don't forget to run `serverless deploy` to deploy the function to the cloud.
